# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Fashion-MNIST-Classification
The goal is to build a convolutional neural network. Fashion-MNIST data was chosen for this model for few reason. First, it will provide the fundamentals in building a convolutional neural network. Second, it is a more challenging dataset than the commonly used MNIST.

*Dataset*

The fashion_mnist data: 60,000 train and 10,000 test data with 10 categories. Each gray-scale image is 28x28.
